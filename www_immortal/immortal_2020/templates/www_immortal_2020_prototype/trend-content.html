				  		<h6>Typically pioneers and trailblazers, Zenatics seek 
							lifestyle options that dovetail with their strongly defined 
							ideals and values. They view wellness as a lifelong 
							pursuit, and seek a holistic approach that is more 
							preventative than reactive, focusing on detoxification 
							and revitalization. Wellness for them also means the 
							opportunity to escape and unplug from the pressure 
							cooker of everyday life.
							<br><br>
							Being early adopters, Zenatics exert an influence over 
							their peer groups – their attitudes and lifestyle choices 
							reflect heightened awareness, providing the inspiration 
							that then informs less progressive consumer segments. 
							These traits make Zenatics a highly desirable 
							demographic, one that marketers, retailers and service 
							providers should prioritise. Tracking Zenatics’ lifestyle 
							preferences helps brands to forecast and predict 
							upcoming consumer trends; something that will become 
							increasingly pertinent as the choices of this group shifts 
							from niche to mainstream.
							<br><br>
							The Zenatic’s evolved approach and outlook towards 
							wellness will also have a definite impact on how they 
							travel, and will ultimately be a crucial consideration for 
							their choice of travel destination when it comes to 
							leisure and down time. With that in mind, the travel 
							industry should adapt and pivot products and services to 
							accommodate the growing Medi-Wellness segment.

					<div class="project-content col-12 col-md-6 animated fadeIn">
				  		<h6>Hospitality industry research has shown that wellness tourists seek out travel destinations that are idyllic and fairly 		bucolic, staying for an average duration of five days. They also desire destinations that provide a unified approach to care. This includes a selection of health and wellness-related pursuits, with qualified personnel and experts on hand to advise and fine-tune their living habits and personal wellness practices.
						<br><br>
						Wellness travelers also seek out accommodation that adhere to particular standards, with features such as air and water 		purification, hypoallergenic materials, cutting-edge sleep and productivity enhancing lighting. Catering for wellness 		travellers should be advantageous for brands since they spend on average 130% more than regular tourists and tend to be loyal, seeking out convenience, expertise, personalisation, and most of all value.

						<h2>Holistic<br>Holly</h2>
						<h6>To give life to what personal health and wellbeing 
							might possibly resemble in the near future we’ve

							Asian millennial, Holly was likely born in 1980 or later. 
							Typically middle class and possibly single, partnered 
							or a parent, Holly is educated and cosmopolitan. She’s 
							tuned in to global trends and developments, and has 
							one finger constantly scrolling multiple social media 
							feeds, tapping into prevailing socio-cultural 
							heartbeats. An active networker with a strong peer 
							group, Holly is constantly connected and feels both 
							empowered and overwhelmed by information. A digital

						<h6>Holly’s Asian upbringing means she is familiar with 
							both Traditional Asian and Western medical practices, 
							and is receptive towards both schools. Holly believes 
							that wellness is a lifetime endeavour, requiring a 
							holistic approach to overall health that gives mind, 
							body and spirit equal consideration. Holly can also be 
							described as a fitness omnivore, valuing customisable 
							activities that can be tailored not only to her busy 
							schedule, but which are also congruent with her own 
							personal fitness goals and lifestyle objectives.
							<br><br>
							Holly is a definite value appreciator and urban escapist 
							always on the look out for a good deal to facilitate her 
							next sojourn, from all-inclusive packages to the perks 
							of an exclusive membership, she is motivated by a 
							strong desire to escape the daily grind. In short, Holly is 
							a Zenatic, seeking balance and enrichment in a highly
